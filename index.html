          <h2>From Bacteria to Beef</h2>
          <p>
            Can bacterial species synthesize proteins that taste like beef? Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. In partnership with Improbable Beef, a food start-up, we have performed a research study to find the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste.<br><br>The hypothesis is that there is a microorganism that can supply the next best taste which is believed it can be found on the human body, ideally in the belly button. The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria, and different parts of the body harbour different species. Between individuals, bacterial species may vary even in the same location. Therefore, we have collected an extensive sample from the navel of many volunteers to conduct this study.<br><br> This interactive dashboard will visualize the research discovery of the bacterial data collected from each volunteer. Each person has been assigned an ID number in which you will be able to access the following information: a demographic information (such as ethnicity, gender, age, location), a bar chart of the top 10 bacteria cultures found in their belly buttons, a frequency gauge of how often their belly buttons is scrubbed per week, and a bubble chart that shows the amount of bacteria culture per sample.<br><br> Should Improbable Beef identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, we shall be able to pinpoint whether that species is found in one of our volunteerâ€™s navel. In the meantime, if you are a volunteer and are curios about the bacteria species living in your belly button in comparison to others, you can also have fun digging through the findings yourself.
